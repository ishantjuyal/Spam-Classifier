# Spam-Classifier
This week, I tried the most basic Spam Classifier. 

I tokenized all the words first and then made a |V| shaped array for each email with each element representing how many times that word occurs in the email. 

I used Random Forest Classifier to classify the emails into spam or not. 

These are the results:

Precision Score = 99.7%
Recall Score = 96.02%
F1 Score = 0.9782
